Video Game Search Engine

An idea we were able to brainstorm very quickly was our love for video games. However, something that came up was our mutual dislike of the video game market. Because of the consumer mentality that has been built through platforms like Valve’s Steam, gamers are purchasing content in abundance and hardly, if ever, getting through their entire library of games. We felt a personal obligation to try and create something that would help gamers make more mindful, informed choices about what video games they would both be able to purchase and actually complete. 

Our initial goal was to create an advanced video game search engine that took in a variety of parameters and returned a game based on those specifications. What we hoped would distinguish us from the average game database is that this service would create a detailed profile of each user based off predictive modeling. The more a user interacts with the program, the better GameTime would be able to work for them. That said, we wanted to make this project a very streamlined and simple experience for the user.  

We thought it would be a reasonable project in terms of scope, considering we had already found a pre-existing API that held a large number of games (IGDB). We brainstormed a number of parameters that we deemed critical to this search engine (such as ESRB ratings, player difficulty, game genre, anticipated completion time, and what console it could be run on) and aimed to build a website that provided a light, conversational tone with the user while guiding them toward our engine’s recommended games. We anticipated that using the API would be a relatively easy task and that the difficulty would be getting it to work in concurrence with the algorithm.

We are proud to have accomplished our goal!
